# MyuTwitchBot
A simple Twitch bot that can easily be configured.

<br>

# Download

<br>

# The Future
Pretty soon I want to add the ability to have multiple responses per command and ahve the bot send only one of them at random!

<br>

# config.json example
```json
{
    "twitchUsername": "Your Twitch Username ðŸ’œ",
    "channelName": "Your Twitch Username ðŸ’œ",
    "authToken": "Generated token",
    "subMessagePrime": "Message for new prime subscribers ðŸ§¡",
    "subMessageTier1": "Message for new tier 1 subscribers ðŸ’œ",
    "subMessageTier2": "Message for new tier 2 subscribers ðŸ’œðŸ’œ",
    "subMessageTier3": "Message for new tier 3 subscribers ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ"
}
```
* You can generate your token [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) (This will link to an external website).

# commands.json example
```json
[
    // This is a single response command and will return only one message
    {
        "Trigger": "!discord",
        "Responses": [ 
            "Invite to your Discord server :D"   
        ]
    },
    // This is a multi response command and will return one of the responses at random
    {
        "Trigger": "!schedule",
        "Responses": [ 
            "Some schedule information ðŸ“…",
            "Here is my schedule ðŸ“…"   
        ]
    }
]
```
* You can basicly make infinite commands, each with one custom response.
